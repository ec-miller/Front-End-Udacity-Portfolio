Hi, my name is Eric Miller. I recently earned a Grow With Google scholarship
for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. This website is a portfolio
of the projects that I am completing as part of my studies.

Note that these projects are works in progress and will be completed over the next 5 months. I will update the History section below as the projects are completed.

In the cards in the site you can try out the finished products or view their GitHub repositories. Enjoy!
